title: Start from scratch

### Failure
Clearly there has been some trouble with my current strategy to start work on my 20% time project. I've decided to take a new approach. While working with Principal Willis we decided that a short film may be a bit too ambitious for the time frame and so we've restructured. The new idea we're going off is just the standard interviews but with a twist to bring it up to speed with my full talents. We're making a bunch of videos.

### Pretend you're people
One of the things I'm doing to make the project up to the level I want is personalizing for our various demographics. Each middle school will get its own video with a couple interviews from students of each middle school talking about how the transition was. The graphics will be reanimated and customized to call out each school by name which is something no other high school is trying. This will certainly allow *The Academy* to stand out among other highschools. We'll also be making a version speaking directly to parents that will help teach parents what this school is about and how it could benefit their students.

### Production
I will be working closely with Mr. Brent to help get access to teachers for interviews as well as he can help me get footage while I'm in class. He's going to mainly make sure all the content is in order which is perfect for me because I am more of a director than a writer. Overall, I look forward to seeing how this new direction for the project makes the school better and gets things done that are actually useful.
