title: Making Motion Graphics

## Mr. Motion
While Mr. Brent has been working on the storyboard, I've been playing around with the idea of [Motion Graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_graphics). Basically, it's animated graphic design to make this video look *way* more professioal. So far I have two of the main graphics already completed, the main title and the lower third. I've made gifs of them to better showcase my work.

## Main titles

The main title was a simplistic moving title. I felt like if I had all of that in a static non-moving shot it just wouldn't nearly catch the attention that the fully animated version does. This is animated to integrate with the little bug in the corner. The bug is my nickname for the ASE logo in the lower left. I'll be using that term frequently as what it lacks in descriptiveness it makes up for in straight forward usage

## Lower Third

This one also integrates with the "bug". The bug moves to draw attention to the lower area of the screen where the lower third comes out to explain who a person is and how they're relevant. This technique is common for interview video/television. It folds up afterwards back to the regular bug. Transitioning between the bug and the graphics is important so that viewers don't see "hard cuts" that, in my opinion, take the elegance out of motion graphics.
