title: Doing interviews (finally).
---

Before we get started with the regular blog post. Here is a quick progress report of what I've done recently and the blog posts that show where they've been done. At the end of this post you'll also find a list of what still needs to be done to see the goals I'm holding myself to at this point. This won't normally be done but it's for the [mid-project reflection](https://mccsc.instructure.com/courses/17148/assignments/25863/submissions/15991).

## What we've done so far (with links):

* [Planning feasibly](http://school.blog.owenwalters.net/2016/02/10/Getting-Started/)
* [Switch to interviews](http://school.blog.owenwalters.net/2016/03/04/questions/)
* [Planned base video](http://school.blog.owenwalters.net/2016/03/25/PleaseHelpImOnFire/)
* [Designed Graphics for video](http://school.blog.owenwalters.net/2016/04/01/graphics/)

At the current moment we're working on interviews. I still want a fully scripted segment of the video but the interviews are the "most important" part meaning the part that the video would be most incomplete without.

## The Questions we're going to ask

So far the questions we have for students are as follows:

* What is a fun or funny moment you’ve had at ASE?
* What does project based learning mean to you?
* What was your favorite project?
* What is an opportunity you can get here than you can’t get at other schools?
* What is a common misconception about ASE?
* Can you join extra-curricular activities? Other schools?  Favorites?
* Who is your favorite teacher?  Why?

Some of these questions like "What does project based learning mean to you?" are to use straight answers from. There are others like "What is a fun or funny moment you’ve had at ASE?" that will be used more for fun reaction shots or to get someone to be in a more positive light about the school.

## The Interviews where we ask those questions

The interviews will be done on symposium next Tuesday. About 10 students have been hand picked for interviews and we'll grab a few more here and there if we can. We want natural and interesting environments so all though we'll be meeting in the conference room we probably won't film in there too much.

## What we still need to do:

* Actually film interviews
* Write script for narrative of video
* Film that
* Cut it all together
* Make different versions for different schools
* Turn in and recieve all them points.
