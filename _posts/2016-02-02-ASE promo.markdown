title: My ASE Promotional Film
---

For my 20% time project I knew I wanted to do something with film but it took me a while to figure out what exactly. I knew making something that was just dry interviews would be way too cliche and boring. On the other hand going too far on the entertainment would cause it to be uninformative so my goal was to ultimately find a balance. My final decision ending up being one big video that I could treat like a film shoot rather than just making a video. The goal being that it would be entertainment and informative.
