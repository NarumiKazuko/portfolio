## A catchphrase

My current task is to find a catchphrase for the video. Something like MCCSC's "I'll bet you didn't know" video. Their most recent video's catchphrase is ["Thanks MCCSC"](http://mccsc.edu/site/default.aspx?PageID=1). My current idea is "At The Academy I can `[Academy Specific Opportunity]` but also `[benefit of a traditional school you wouldn't associate with ASE]`."

## WhooshWubWub (Motion Design)

My other set of decisions to make is on the animated graphics. Right now I'm thinking of basing it off [Google's Material Design](http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html) and maybe some [long (5 o' clock) shadows](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/ecda6e6888299543f96a5611ca5d44806bbc5ba0/687474703a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f63576b4b394a522e676966). It's a modern look that's common with a lot of designs. I'll be animating the [school logo](http://www.mccsc.edu/cms/lib07/IN01906545/Centricity/Template/GlobalAssets/images///logos/ASE-no_bkgd_logo.png) using these techniques.
