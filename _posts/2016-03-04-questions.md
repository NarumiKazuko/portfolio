title: Q and A(way)

Now that I'm leaving a [scripted format](2016/02/26/restructure/ "Previously on...") I have to prepare to do interviews. The current idea involves using multiple interviews and different edits. To make sure that every video has content appropriate to its own demograhpic. In order to this I have two catagories of interviews.

## Student

- *What was the biggest change about moving on from* **<<MIDDLE SCHOOL>>** *?*
- *What is your favorite project so far?*
- *What do you want incoming freshman from* **<<MIDDLE SCHOOL>>** *to know about the school?*
- *What makes you look forward to a day at school?*
- *What was your favorite project?*

## Teacher

- *How long have you been teaching at ASE?*
- *What have you been teaching at ASE?*
- *Which project of yours is a student favorite?*
- *What makes ASE different from other high schools?*
- *How long have you been teaching at ASE?*

## Away
I'm still rather concerned about being away. I won't have much progress next week as I will be away at BPA. Luckily I will be trying my best to work during the conference and get as much done as I possibly can. My 20% time project sometimes takes a backburner so I'm going to have to be *really* on the ball this next week.
