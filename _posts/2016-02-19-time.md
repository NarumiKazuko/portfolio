### I want to fly like an eagle.

Obviously this project is ambitious but that's really what I like about it. Unfortanately that means I've significantly underestimated the amount of time I need in order to complete it. As I undergo a big reschedule and a full weekend of working on this project. I will try to keep moving forward and updating this blog regularly to keep a running, transparent status of my work.

### Let my spirit carry me

So my plan for this one is to work my butt off over the weekend to see if I can get caught up with my work before trying to rearrange [the deadlines](http://school.blog.owenwalters.net/2016/02/10/Getting-Started/ "previous post"). I will try to finish the storyboard and script over the weekend so I can have it pitched to some of my supervisors on this project. I'm hoping this works out so I can stay on track with what I need to do.
