## Personal Statement

My name is Owen Walters. I'm currently a junior at The Academy of Science and Entrepreneurship and I have wanted to go here for a long time. Right now, I'm hoping ASE assists in achieving my dreams. Previously I went to The Project School. I consider my strengths in this school to be my creativity and talent with technology. I enjoy working with video and computers In fact, those are two things that make up a lot of the things featured in this portfolio.
Over my time in education I have created a number of things using my skills. I have created promotional media, and even done school assignments in different ways than they were typically done using my creative talents. Again I find my skills greatest in video. So I have often created a lot of film projects.
I know I have done a lot of similar things for this portfolio, it's just what I like doing and what I like people seeing. I hope to do this for the rest of my life. This something I'd do as a job. My work is something I hope will impress everyone.

## My goals for the future

I hope to work with film and the internet as much as possible during my career. My end goal is to be a professional visual effects artist. To get there I hope to do well in high school, get in to a great college and then do well there. At the moment I'm mostly doing videos and websites for free although eventually I hope to make it a real job.

## Autobiography of Owen Walters

My name is Owen Walters. I am born and raised in Bloomington, Indiana. I live at home with my brother Graham, as well as my mother and father. We also have a dog named Ruby.

My hobbies include making videos, designing websites and using the internet. I find these activities are a great way of practicing my skills with computers. In my free time I run my own websites <<http://www.owenwalters.net/>> and <<http://www.meanelephant.com/>>
I also work with Business Professionals of America and have done pretty well recently allowing me to grow in the workplace.

At school I like to use my technical skills for class projects as well as extra curriculars. For instance my skills in computer animation took me to Business Professionals of America's National Final competition. I also got first place at regionals for desktop publishing at a Business Professionals of America competition. During my sophomore year I made national level competition for Fundamentals of web design. I specialize in design and animation skills which I use to help my school. For extra income I am a media manager for my church as well as a freelance motion designer for Mixed Media Studios.

In the future I plan to graduate high school with at least a core 40 degree. This will help me get into a college like Indiana University. My goal is to major in film and informatics. In the future I hope to be able to do visual effects or animation professionally as my main career. I am also able to do print and web design as some side hobbies.

Fifteen years from now as I mentioned previously I hope to be doing visual effects or motion design as a career. I find it is a career very rewarding and fun to do. My plan to get to the job I want is through trying to get a good degree as well as a lot of work experience.

## Sophomore reflection

A takeaway I have about my growth is the newfound work ethic I have gained over the course of the year. There were times during my freshman year that not only would I turn in some of my assignments late it wasn't uncommon for me to just miss things. Now I'm much more aware of my assignments and due dates, I have higher grades in work ethic, and I'm turning in more. I've been improving more as I go along and I look forward to next year.
My work has definitely improved in the amount of time put into it. When I first entered this school I'd hate the idea of having to work on a project at home, now I do that everyday of the school year. There were times I would forget tests, due dates, even a final but my issues with disorganization and forgetfulness have improved greatly. As I go through The Academy I hope to continue to grow and improve especially in important areas like keeping my work and turning it in.
I think a good example of a change in my mindset that's happened over the course of this year is with writing. Before, a five paragraph essay seemed extremely boring and difficult to me but after the World Food Prize essay it seems that I can take just about any other writing assignment with ease. In all seriousness though I feel my stamina for writing has greatly increased and I find myself writing more in my free time than I did at the beginning of Freshman year.
A valuable learning experience I had this year was the Epic project in which we looked at The Odyssey as well as the book of Genesis. I found a great way to look at these classic texts in a new light and really understand what it is that they had to say. During these projects me and my partners were able to do intense analysis of these and emulate their styles in practically no time at all. I think gaining those skills have already helped me, for example on the English 10 ECA.
One of the ways my goals have changed is that I'm not just focused on film and video. I now have a fallback plan for my career. I have a school picked out to hopefully help prepare me for both of my career options. However, On top of all of that I've found my hobbies expanding as well. I've started taking up more and more of my time with web design as well as a fair amount of increased creative writing (for scripts but I think it still counts as expanding.) Overall I believe my future is both well planned but also not completely predictable which is really just a good place to be for me.
As a whole I think I've become a more organized and more productive person. As I mentioned I've become more organized, a better writer, and just seen an overall increase in work ethic. I think I've learned a lot about my school myself, and my work over the past two years. In general I've grown a lot as the school has grown and I'm hoping to keep growing. I really do hope I continue to grow next year at The Academy as much as I have these past 3 years.
