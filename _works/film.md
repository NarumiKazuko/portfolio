This video is a short film I made for my Film Literature class. This was written by everyone in the group however I did the direction as well as all of post production. This is another example of my use of visual effects as the portrait in the first scene was actually a green screen. I then recreated a painting effect on a photo then matched it seamlessly with the lighting of the original shot. The film was edited in Adobe Premiere with visual effects done in Adobe After Effects and Photoshop. It was shot on a Sony Alpha 5200.
